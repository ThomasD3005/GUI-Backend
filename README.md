# GUI-Backend
Version 2 of my GUI's backend concepts
- MySQL Database Connection
- Matplotlib Graph
- Numpy / Pandas 
- Import / Export .csv files

These concepts will be used to create a fully functional and efficent user interface to analyze data stored in a database. Data analysis requires a deeper look into statisics and interpretation to draw conclusions. This is a theme I am applying when creating this user interface. The app will contain these and many more in the future.
